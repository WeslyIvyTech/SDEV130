
Structured approach to planning the game:
1. Define the Game Structure:
Categories: 6 categories in total.
Questions per Category: 5 questions per category (30 questions total).
Point Values: Each question has point values ranging from 100 to 500, increasing with difficulty.
2. Game Flow:
Players: Set the number of players (3 contestants).
Scoreboard: Implement a tracking system to display and update each player’s score.
Timer: Set a 30-second time limit for answering each question. Ensure the timer resets for each new question.
Gameboard: Display all categories with available point values on a gameboard.
Category and Point Selection: Players choose a category and point value.
Question Display: Display the selected clue/question associated with the category and point value.
Contestant Response: Capture the contestant’s response, verifying that it is phrased in the form of a question (e.g., "What is...").
3. Error Handling:
If no response is given within the time limit, move to the next contestant.
Ensure only one contestant answers at a time, and prevent others from interrupting.
4. Score Calculation:
Correct Answer: Add the point value to the contestant’s score.
Incorrect Answer: Deduct the point value from the contestant’s score and allow other contestants to respond.
After all contestants have responded or no response is given, move to the next question.
5. Game Ending:
The game continues until all 30 questions have been answered.
Final Jeopardy (optional): Contestants wager points and answer a final question.
6. Roles:
Contestant: Answers questions by selecting categories and point values.
Moderator: Manages the game, including revealing questions, timing answers, verifying correctness, and updating scores.
